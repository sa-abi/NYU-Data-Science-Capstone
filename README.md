# Leverage-OncoKBs-Database-to-Build-an-NLP-Biomarker-Identifier

## Overview
This repository contains the work for our Master's capstone project at NYU, focusing on the development of a Named Entity Recognition (NER) model to enhance cancer research. Our model automates gene annotation in research articles, improving the accuracy of the OncoKB database.

## Project Description
We applied machine learning and NLP techniques to develop a model that identifies and classifies genetic mutations in oncological research. Our approach uses Biomed-BERT to categorize genes as Oncogenes, Tumor Suppressors, or Both.

## Installation
Instructions on how to set up the project environment.

```bash
# Example installation steps
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
Guide users on how to use your project.

```python
# Example usage
python run_model.py
```

## Results
Discuss the model's performance, precision, recall rates, and its impact on the OncoKB database.
